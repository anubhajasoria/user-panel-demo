Hi,

Please checkout the demo task code here. This project has been created using Vite and the design is responsive.

Tools and Libraries I have used :

- Redux toolkit
- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite React
- React Route

Functionalities not implemented due to time constraints:

- Add new user
- Edit other details except for username (username is currently editable)
- Validations (would be added using yup and formik)

Note: It can be added easily if I spend more time on this project.

Steps to run:

- npm install
- npm run dev
